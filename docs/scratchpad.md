## Lessons
- When using Next.js with RTL languages, set both `lang="ar"` and `dir="rtl"` in the HTML tag
- For Arabic support, use the Noto Sans Arabic font from Google Fonts
- When using custom CSS with Tailwind, be careful with at-rules like `@theme` that might not be standard
- SVG placeholders are useful for development before actual images are available
- Component-based architecture makes it easy to organize and maintain the codebase
- **Modern Design Implementation (2024-09-29):**
  - Glass morphism effects work well with backdrop-filter and rgba backgrounds
  - Fixed positioning for floating navigation requires proper z-index management
  - Dark theme with proper contrast ratios improves readability
  - Animated components should be reusable and configurable
  - When transforming existing components, preserve all original content and functionality
  - CSS custom properties are essential for consistent theming across components
- **Auth Pages Design (2025-09-30):**
  - Clean white backgrounds with subtle borders work well for auth pages
  - Maintain brand colors (primary blue and secondary orange) for consistency
  - Use simple, centered layouts for login/signup forms
  - Include proper validation and error messaging
  - Loading states improve UX during async operations
  - Link back to home page for easy navigation
  - AuthContext integration allows for seamless authentication flow
- **Booking Flow Redesign (2025-09-30):**
  - Applied clean white design with border-gray-200 borders and rounded-2xl corners
  - Enhanced progress indicator with checkmarks for completed steps
  - Improved calendar with better spacing (gap-2) and ring indicators for today
  - Time slots use border-2 for better visual hierarchy
  - Problem description tags with hover states for better interactivity
  - Success page with gradient backgrounds and icon-based instructions
  - Consistent button styling: primary for main actions, secondary for CTAs
  - All components use shadow-sm for subtle depth without heavy shadows
